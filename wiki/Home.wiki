= FLIPS =

A Flight Instruction Processing System for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles

= What Is It? =

FLIPS is a programming language for defining UAV missions and flight behaviors. High-level missions are compiled into a hardware-independent instruction set architecture (ISA), which you can freely implement on your own UAV platforms. The goal is to provide a better layer of abstraction between the user and the flight hardware.

Here's how it works:

  # The user will specify a mission in the high-level FLIPS language.
  # The mission is compiled into FLIPS Assembly, which contains low-level flight instructions (according to the FLIPS ISA).
  # The FLIPS Assembly code is then translated into hardware-specific radio packets, C/C++ code, etc. specific to your UAV platform.
  # Your UAV platform implements the FLIPS ISA, which provides instructions to update PID control loop parameters, setpoints, actuator positions, flight sequences, conditional and repetitive flight behaviors, communications, sensors, and others.
  # The UAV executes the mission.

Since the language is hardware-independent, you can share your missions with others; even if they are using different hardware. By developing a library of flight behaviors and missions, UAV projects using FLIPS can try out new missions and flight behaviors quickly and easily. The UAV community as a whole will benefit from a common library of mission-level code.

= What Does A Mission Look Like? =

A mission's syntax should be highly readable and easy to understand, without the complexity of a traditional programming language. Have a look:

{{{
waypoints
  SanfordStadium = 84.324n 98.433w
  Boyd = 84.234n 98.843w
  Home = 84.523n 98.823w

commands
  TakeAPicture = 0x01       // Command 1
  DeployTheParachute = 0b10 // Command 2

Takeoff
fly to 78.754n 32.463w for 1 hour 12 sec
fly to 78.754 -32.463 for 1:00:12
fly to 78d 45' n 32d 27' w for 3612s
fly ssw at 7.3m/s for 3 min
fly heading 242 deg at cruise speed for 10 minutes descending 50 ft
fly to SanfordStadium at max speed at fl250
TakeAPicture
fly to Boyd at 75.3% throttle
TakeAPicture
loiter clockwise at 15mph for 37 seconds
go to Home
fly at 0 percent power
DeployTheParachute
Land
}}}

The mission above is then compiled into the following flight instructions, which can be understood by the flight hardware:
