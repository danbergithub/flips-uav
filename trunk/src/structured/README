Here's how to get started compiling your first program with FLIPS.

1. “svn update” on the repository to get the latest changes.
2. “cd src/structured” to move into that directory.
3. “bash compile” to compile the java code.
4. “bash run” to run example1.uav and output the result to the screen.
5. Edit the “run” file to change the location of your FLIPS program, as desired.
